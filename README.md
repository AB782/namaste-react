# React Hooks

(Normal JS functions ) - written by Facebook developers

- useState() - Superpowerful React Variables

- call on top when function starts
- used to create Local state variables inside functional components
- never create inside if-Else conditions

* Always use useState outside the body component

# UseEffect()

- useEffect() - used when we have to call a function after rendering the file
  syntax -

useEffect(() =>{
console.log("useEffect Called)
},[])

- uses a dependancy array(optional)

3 Conditions of useEffect()

1. if NO dependancy array - useEffect will be called everytime the component renders
2. if EMPTY dependancy array - useEffect called once at the beginning
3. if Dependancy array - it will be called everytime the dependancy updates

- Client Side Routing : like this site we are developing, there are no network calls,
  everything we need is already loaded into the site

- Server Side Routing : when there's a network call, whenever a new page loads, a network call is made and data is fetched from there
